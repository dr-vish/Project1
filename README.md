# Part A

For this part of the project, I have used a hepatitis dataset from the UCI repository and cleaned the dataset by ensuring rows represent columns, and columns represent variables. The variables have been read in the appropriate data type/ class and transformed all the variables to their appropriate data type/ class. Cleaning of variable names is done and missing data has been represented correctly.
