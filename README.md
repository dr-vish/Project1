# Part A

For this part of the project, I have used a hepatitis dataset from the UCI repository and cleaned the dataset by ensuring rows represent columns, and columns represent variables. The variables have been read in the appropriate data type/ class and transformed all the variables to their appropriate data type/ class. Cleaning of variable names is done and missing data has been represented correctly. 

# Part B

For this part of the project: 
I identified up to 5 categorical and up to 5 continuous variables of my choice.
For each categorical variable, I printed counts for each level.
For each categorical variable, I made a mosaic plot or barplot of counts.
For each continuous variable, print mean, median, and standard deviation.
For each continuous variable, plotted its distribution using a boxplot or a histogram (pick one type of plot and use it for all continuous variables).
